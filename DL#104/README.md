# Feedforward Neural Network

## Do we need a complex function?

- Up till now we see 3 models , those are MP neuron, Perceptron, Sigmoid Neuron respectively. But no model can handle the `non-linearly separable data `
- Example If the mobile of screen size 3.5 to 5.5 and price from 9k - 13k are most affordable rather than other mobile phones then no module can actually help to separate this kind of dataset.

- Sigmoid neuron is one of the continuous model but failed to separate this data, hence te reason why we require more complex functions.
